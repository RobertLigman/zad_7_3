        <h2>Song title: Maps</h2>
        <p>I miss the taste of a sweeter life I miss the conversation I’m searching for a song tonight I’m changing all of the stations I like to think that we had it all We drew a map to a better place But on that road I took a fall Oh baby why did you run away?</p>
        <p>I was there for you In your darkest times I was there for you In your darkest nights</p>
        <p>But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst down on my knees
And you said you had my back
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me
So I’m following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain’t nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following</p>
